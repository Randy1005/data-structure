First create the direction table, which is achieved with two 1-D arrays (size 8) storing 8 directions, then random the index to let the bug head towards random directions. As we scan through 
the count matrix(2-D,stores the time the bug touches each tile), once every element is not 0, we break out of the loop and calculate the total steps the bug took.
